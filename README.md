# Travel Application

The travel app includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. It uses the Weatherbit API for the forecasts and Geonames API for coordinates as the Weatherbit will only accept coordinates. It then uses Pixabay API to provide an image of the location entered.
